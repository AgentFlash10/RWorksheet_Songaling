#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
  
  Household_data <- data.frame(
    Shoe_size =c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 7.5, 10.5, 8.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0),
    
    Height =c(66.0, 68.0, 64.5, 65.0, 70.0, 64.0, 70.0, 71.0, 72.0, 64.0, 74.5, 67.0, 71.0, 71.0, 77.0, 72.0, 59.0, 62.0, 72.0, 66.0, 64.0, 67.0, 73.0, 69.0, 72.0, 70.0, 69.0, 70.0),
    
    Gender =c("F", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "M", "M", "M", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "M", "M", "F", "M", "M", "M", "M")
  )
  Household_data
  
  #a. Describe the data.
  #It shows the corresponding shoe size along with their height and gender. It also shows that most males have bigger shoe sizes than females

  #b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height. What its result? Show the R scripts.
  
  male <- subset(Household_data, Gender == "M", select = c(Shoe_size, Height))
  female <- subset(Household_data, Gender == "F", select = c(Shoe_size, Height))
   
  print(male)
  print(female)
  
  #c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
  
  mean_shoesize <- mean(Household_data$Shoe_size)
  mean_height <- mean(Household_data$Height)
  
  cat("Mean shoe size:", (mean_shoesize))
  cat("Mean height:", (mean_height))
  
  #d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
    #Yes, because the data shows that the taller the height, the bigger the shoe size.
  
  
#Factors
#2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
  
  Months <-c("March","April","January","November","January",
"September","October","September","November","August",
"January","November","November","February","May","August", "July","December","August","August","September","November","February", "April")
  
  factor_Months <- factor(Months)
  factor_Months

#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Interpret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
  summary(Months)
  summary(factor_Months)
  
  #The results display how many the months that put in the  vector and display how many of the same months in the vector. It also displays their data type.
  
#4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
  
  Direction <-c("East", "West", "North")
  Frequency <-c(1,4,3)
  
factor_direction <- factor(Direction)
factor_direction

factor_freq <- factor(Frequency)
factor_freq

new_data <- factor(factor_direction,levels = c("East","West","North"))
print(new_data)

new_data2 <- factor(factor_freq,levels = c(1,4,3))
print(new_data2)

#5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv
  
 #a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function. Write the code.
  Exceldata <- read.csv("import_march.csv")
  
  #b. View the data set. Write the R scripts and its result.
  Exceldata

#Using Conditional Statements (IF-ELSE)
#6. Full Search
  
  #a. Create an R Program that allows the User to randomly select numbers from 1 to 50.Then display the chosen number. If the number is beyond the range of the selected choice,it will have to display a string “The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50”. If number 20 is inputted by the User, it will have to display “TRUE”, otherwise display the input number.

  user_input <- readline(prompt = "Enter numbers from 1 to 50: ")
  if(user_input>50){
  print("The number is beyond the range of 1 to 50")
}else{
  print("TRUE")
}

#7 Change
  
  #a. Write a function that prints the minimum number of bills that must be paid, given the price of the snack.Input: Price of snack (a random number divisible by 50) Output: Minimum number of bills needed to purchase a snack.

minimum_price <- function(price){
  
  minprice <- price %/% 50
  paste("The minimum no. of bills:", minprice)
}

minimum_price(200)


#8. The following is each student’s math score for one semester. Based on this, answer the following questions.

  #a. Create a dataframe from the above table. Write the R codes and its output.
  
  math_scores <- data.frame(
    Name =c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna"),
    
    Grade1=c(85,65,75,95),

  )

  #b. Without using the rowMean function, output the average score of students whose average math score over 90 points during the semester. write R code and its output.Example Output: Annie’s average grade this semester is 88.75.

    print("There is no student that got 90 average grades")
  }
  
  #c.  Without using the mean function, output as follows for the tests in which the average score was less than 80 out of 4 tests. Example output: The nth test was difficult.

   average_scores <- colMeans(math_scores[, -1])
