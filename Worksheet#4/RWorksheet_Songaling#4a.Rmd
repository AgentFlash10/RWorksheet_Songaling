## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
  
  shoesize_height_data <- data.frame(
    Shoe_size =c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 7.5, 10.5, 8.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0),

  #a. Describe the data.
  summary(shoesize_height_data)

  #b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height. What its result? Show the R scripts.
  
  male_subset <- subset(shoesize_height_data, Gender == "M", select = c(Shoe_size, Height))
   female_subset <- subset(shoesize_height_data, Gender == "F", select = c(Shoe_size, Height))
   
  print(male_subset)
  print(female_subset)
  
  #c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
  
  mean_shoesize <- mean(shoesize_height_data$Shoe_size)
  mean_height <- mean(shoesize_height_data$Height)
  
  cat("Mean shoe size:", (mean_shoesize))
  cat("Mean height:", (mean_height))
  
  #d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
    #Yes, because the data shows that the taller the height, the bigger the shoe size.
  
  
  #Factors
  #2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
  
  Months <-c("March","April","January","November","January","September","October","September","November","August","January","Novermber","November","February","May","August","July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")
