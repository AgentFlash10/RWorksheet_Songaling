## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#code here
#1
LETTERS

letters

  #a You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters
  letters <- head(LETTERS,11)
  letters
    
  #b Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
  oddletters <-LETTERS[seq(1,26,2)]
  oddletters
  
  #c Produce a vector that contains the vowels
  vowels_letters <-
  
  #d Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.
  lowercase_letters <-
  lowercase_letters

  
  
```
